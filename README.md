# Deep Learning Notebooks

Here are my jupyter notebooks on deep learning. All of them are written in pytorch and most of them use the [fastai library](https://github.com/fastai/fastai).

## Tutorials

* [Using the new training API in fastai](https://github.com/sgugger/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Understanding%20the%20new%20fastai%20API%20for%20scheduling%20training.ipynb).
* [Building a simple neural net in pytorch](https://github.com/sgugger/Deep-Learning/blob/master/First%20neural%20net%20in%20pytorch.ipynb).
* [Explore the fastai callback system](https://github.com/sgugger/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Using%20the%20callback%20system%20in%20fastai.ipynb).

## Implementation of articles

* [Neural cache pointer](https://github.com/sgugger/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Cache%20pointer.ipynb) introduce by [Grave et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04426)
* [Superconvergence on cifar10](https://github.com/sgugger/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Cyclical%20LR%20and%20momentums.ipynb) using the 1cycle policy introduce by [Leslie Smith](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09820)
* [Deep painterly harmonization](https://github.com/sgugger/Deep-Learning/blob/master/DeepPainterlyHarmonization.ipynb) from [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03189)

The rest is just a bun of random stuff shared with fellow fastai students.
